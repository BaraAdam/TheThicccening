- "This planet ain't thicc enough for the two of us."

Defend our world from a beefy assault from the evil horde of the notorious galatic invaders known as "The Thiccclings". Use your bulky batallion of turrets to shoot across enemy lines and defend your tower from the hefty hands of the aliens! Turrets can be placed on the long, lanky path leading to the tower, which will fire a midst of broad bullets into the solid, fat, blubbery skin of the horribly and morbidly obese beings.

Finish fast! Even one of those flabby evildoers is enough to jeopardize the health of your bulbous tower. Survive as long as you can - the Thiccclings are known for their gargantuan stamina in battle. Invaders will continue to attack in waves until you beat them all off, and not a single one remains. Advance to the final level and end their whole rotund race!
